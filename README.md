# RSS Feeds

A collection of my personal RSS feeds ingest here. Links are mostly related to work with Systems Administration, Information Security, and Freedom of Information (folders arranged respectively)

I use currently use [Feedbro](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/), however the main `feedbro-subs` file should work with any RSS plugin/application that accepts imports of `.opml` files.

There is currently a single rule in the `.json` file accompanying the feeds, which is set to alert me of any news relating to software/appliction vulnerabilities.
