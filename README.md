# RSS Feeds

A collection of my personal RSS feeds ingest here. Links are mostly related to Tech, Science, Philosophy, and Freedom of Information (folders arranged respectively) - but there is a lot of great stuff too. I also use RSS for Youtube channels so... there are some other random things in there.

I currently use [Tiny Tiny RSS](https://tt-rss.org/) with a self-hosted environment (web client), but have also messed around with [Feedbro](https://nodetics.com/feedbro/), however the main `subs` file should work with any RSS plugin/application that accepts importing `.opml` files.

There is currently a single rule in the `.json` file accompanying the feeds, which is set to alert me of any news relating to software/appliction vulnerabilities (works with Feedbro, haven't tested with any other client yet).
